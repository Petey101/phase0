####What is a one-to-one database?
A one to one database is where there is a unique relationship found in each of the data of the two tables. The foreign key of one table is related to only one thing in the other table.

####When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
You can use one-to-one databases when there are null values that can be found in one of the tables that you want to avoid filling one of the databases. You can also use them as a way to find out more information about a certain subject that you might not want at a first glance.

####What is a many-to-many database?
A many-to-many database consists of databases that can have multiple ids pointing to multiple things in another table. An example would be, students can have many different classes and these classes all contain multiple students.

####When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
You would want to use a many-to-many database when there are many relationships between the databases. This can let you keep track of these relationships.


####What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
Many-to-many databases are still slightly confusing. One-to-one databases and one-to-many databases make more sense at the moment. This is still all new to me, so I'm not extremely confortable with anything yet.
