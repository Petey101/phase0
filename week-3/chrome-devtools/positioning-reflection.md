How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

You can use Chrome's Devtools to help you format or experiment with different CSS and see the result immediately. The tools help greatly when you are unsure of how you want things done and want to play around with different things.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

Using height and width you can resize different elements.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

The static positioning displays the element in the order of the document. The absolute value is positioned relative to the first non static parent element. The fixed element is relative to the browser window and always stays on the screen. The relative element is relative to its normal position. 
I found fixed element to be the simplest element and relative to be the most difficult. 

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

Margins set the element relative to other elements and the side of the page. Border is the area around your element. Padding is the space between your border and the content itself.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I enjoyed the practice that this challenge provided and I think it will be a great help in the following challenges this week.
