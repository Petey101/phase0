			<h1>What are the benefits of version control?</h1>
			<p>
	 		Version control is used by developers for many reasons, but I believe the biggest one is being able to keep track of their steps and progress. Version control allows you to retrace your steps and find a "good" copy of your work to return to if you should ever need it. Version control also allows others to work on the same project as you at the same time without interfering with one another.

    		<h1>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h1>
    		<p>Git helps you keep track of changes by saving your commits (checkpoints) with messages detailing your changes. This allows you to have a much simpler time if you were to retrace your steps.

			<h1>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h1>
			<p> Using GitHub to store your code allows you to use GitHub's services to share your code with others as well as use it a cloud like system to organize your work. GitHub also has tools you can use to collaborate with other people to work on a single project.

<!--What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	I believe the meta tag with charset="utf-8" is something that I will be using all the time moving foward. Our guide told us that 99% of the time on our documents. I believe I will be using header and footer a lot more in the future as well to flesh out my webpages.


How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
	The elements are mostly laid out in the order they are posted. The browser also displays elements in the order it is posted as well.


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
Snippets seem like they are extremely useful tools when you are working on big projects. They will cut down on repitition and help the developer focus on the more important aspects of the project.
