/* As a user, I want to create a three functions that can take a group or numbers with an unknown length and do three things to them.
I want to be able to take the sum of all the numbers in the group with one function.
I want to be able to take the mean of all the numbers in the group with another function.
Lastly I want to take the median of all the numbers in the group with a final function. 
I want the functions to be named sum, mean, and median respectively.
Remember that the length of these numbers may be of varying sizes so take that in mind.
This last point will affect the median function mostly.
