#What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The 6 phases of web design are information gathering, planning, design, development, testing and delivery, and maintenance.

#What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary goal will be to allow others to see what kind of person I am and the work I have accomplished. The site will contain contact information, previous projects, and a blog.

#What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience will be looking to see what kind of work I can do and what kind of person I am. The projects section of the site should address the kind of work I do and the blog should address any questions about my character.

#What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary action I want the user to see would probably be my porfolio. I am hoping the projects I have posted up there will draw in potential employers. I also want people that want to get to know me to have a look at my blog as well.

#What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

The 6 phases of web design are very important and I believe that is what people should know when designing anything for others.

#What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

User experience is important because sites are generally made to be used by others. You want a site that isn't overly complex and makes sure that the users get what they want when they come to the site without too much trouble.

#Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Nothing from the challenge was really tedious as it was all generally new.
