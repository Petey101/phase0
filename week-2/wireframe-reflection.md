#What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a rough visual guide to how your website will look like in the end. A wireframe will let you know what goes where.

#What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireframing lets you plan a little more indepth than a sitemap does. Wireframing lets the creator have a general idea of how the site would look before aestheics come into play.

#Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I could do without wireframing, but that doesn't mean I don't understand the importance of it. It's tough to know what others would like since you are essentially building a site for others.

#Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I mostly stuck with my first idea because I'm not sure how to improve it yet.

#What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

Other than what was provided in the module, I didn't have any extra questions.

#Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

Nothing was extremely tedious as I was able to use my creative side a bit. I enjoyed envisioning what the end product of the site would be.
