<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
There was more practice using the things I learned and I had ample opportunity to repeat the things I learned creating this site.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
I learned some elements from my partner that we're not included in the codeacademy course that were very useful. It seems like there are many more elements that can be used to change around how the site can be displayed.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
It was relatively simple to keep it simple.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML seems very useful but at the same time very repetitive. There are probably elements that make it simpler or less repetitive that I have not learned yet.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
A handy cheat sheet and plent of practice is probably the best way to remember how to write HTML. I should also remember to always close elements.
