#1.1 Think About Time Reflection
After skimming through the videos and webpages, I found the most interest in the meditation, habits, counter-intuitive productivity, and time box methods.

Currently I set aside time each day to get work done, but I believe I can be much more productive. My current strategy hasn't produced the greatest of results because I don't have a plan going into it. 

It could be because we have just started Phase 0, but I believe setting aside time daily and making it a habit will help greatly. I need to figure out a way to start with tiny goals to make the habit flow more easily and become more natural. The counter-intuitive productivity page was a very interesting read to me and I believe I have a lot to learn from those strategies. Tip #3 on the counter-intuitive productivity page mentions how I can use short 2 minute bursts to get into the groove and seems like something worth trying out.

Time Box is a time management/reflection tool where you, as a group or individual, set aside a certain time frame to work towards a goal and stop once the time has been reached. The stop point for Time Box is time rather than the completion of the project. I believe time boxing can be used to absorb material as well watching productivity in a certain time frame.

For Phase 0, I'll attempt to start each session with a short meditation(not sure which type yet). I will then start with something small to get into the swing of things before I dive into the material. I will also "time box" myself and gauge my productivity to see how I can better use my time.
#1.2 The Command Line Reflection
Shell is a command based interface used to access an operating system's files and services. Bash is the default shell software for Linux and OS X systems.

The most challenging part of this material were the "Do more" parts of each chapter as well as the last few chapters on environment.

I was able to successfully use all the commands, however complete understand on the environment commands still eludes me.

In my opinion the most important commands to know are pwd ls and ../ . Being able to navigate and know where you are is the first step towards being able to do anything else. The help command is also a good command to know about.

pwd - print working directory

ls - list directory

mv- rename directory

cd - change directory

../ - move up a folder

touch - create empty file(New-Item is the command in windows)

mkdir - make directory

less - view a file (more is the command in windows)

rmdir - remove directory

rm - remove

help - used in conjunction with keywords to open certain help windows that help with syntax / what the command does
#1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection  
Creating a repository requires you to click the top right plus icon to open up a drop down menu where you can pick to create a repository. There will be some naming and options that you will need to configure before the creation is finalized.

Forking a repository requires you to go to the repository and click the fork button on the top right and choose your account. 

Cloning a repository requires you to copy the url and use the command git clone in the command lineonce you are in the directory you wish to clone the files into.

I am still not completely comfortable with using git and the command line but some of the interface commands were recalled without using any references. I learned that the interface usage of github is very simple and easily navigated by a newbie.
