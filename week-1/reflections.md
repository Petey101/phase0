#1.1 Think About Time Reflection
After skimming through the videos and webpages, I found the most interest in the meditation, habits, counter-intuitive productivity, and time box methods.

Currently I set aside time each day to get work done, but I believe I can be much more productive. My current strategy hasn't produced the greatest of results because I don't have a plan going into it. 

It could be because we have just started Phase 0, but I believe setting aside time daily and making it a habit will help greatly. I need to figure out a way to start with tiny goals to make the habit flow more easily and become more natural. The counter-intuitive productivity page was a very interesting read to me and I believe I have a lot to learn from those strategies. Tip #3 on the counter-intuitive productivity page mentions how I can use short 2 minute bursts to get into the groove and seems like something worth trying out.

Time Box is a time management/reflection tool where you, as a group or individual, set aside a certain time frame to work towards a goal and stop once the time has been reached. The stop point for Time Box is time rather than the completion of the project. I believe time boxing can be used to absorb material as well watching productivity in a certain time frame.

For Phase 0, I'll attempt to start each session with a short meditation(not sure which type yet). I will then start with something small to get into the swing of things before I dive into the material. I will also "time box" myself and gauge my productivity to see how I can better use my time.
