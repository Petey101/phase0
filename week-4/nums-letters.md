#What does puts do?
"Puts" prints the output to the console on another line.

#What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a whole number and a float is a number with decimal points.

#What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
In integer division, you will only get an integer back even if there is a remainder. For example, 9/4 will get you 2. If you were to use float division and input 9.0/4.0 you would get 2.25. 

# mini challenges

```ruby
puts 24 * 365
puts 60 * 24 * 365 * 10
```

#How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Ruby uses +, -, * and / to deal with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division respectively.

#What is the difference between integers and floats?
Integers are numbers without decimals and floats are numbers with decimals.

#What is the difference between integer and float division?
Integer division only returns whole numbers and rounds down to the nearest whole number. Float division would return the exact number in decimals.

#What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings are a group of anything as long as they are between single quotes. You use strings as a way to manipulate the contents inside with other ruby commands.

#What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Variables are a name given to strings so that they are more easily manipulated. 

#How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
This challenge was a great review of some of the work we did before the interview. It's nice to be able to work with some comfort after a few weeks of being completely new to the content.
